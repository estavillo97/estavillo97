### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Estavillo, a passionate about data, predictive models, and finance individual. My expertise lies in Python, Excel, SQL, and other essential tools, to extract actionable insights from complex datasets and drive data-informed decision-making. 


Since I was a kid, I was curious about numbers, writing, and finance, but it wasn't until I discovered the stock market that I decided to learn to invest and pursue a bachelor's in finance engineering.  While in university, I discovered the world of programming and how you can combine writing with the world of numbers to do so, and then got a specialization in machine learning to achieve my goals.  
Some projects I have worked on: 


Associated with the CEO of Quant Dynamics to develop algorithmic trading strategies to predict the stock market and gave some courses and presentations at universities like UdeG. 

first position in Latin America in a quant finance competition hosted by World Quant, where we develop mathematical predictive models for the stock market. After the competition, I got a work there.  

Teamed up with classmates to make an artificial intelligence model to predict default on lent credits for a startup named Digitt. The company liked the model and hired me to work in the new Data Science division analyzing data to improve credit lending decisions. 

Professional practices in algorithmic trading developing mathematical predictive models for the stock market. 

Making Sense LLC contacted me to join his new algorithmic trading project where I have performed as an algorithmic trading developer for +2 years working mostly with a hedge fund partner creating strategies, improving the portfolio, and researching better ways to take decisions based on data.
